# what is an algorithm ?
- a process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task 
- it's the foundation for beign successfully developer and problem solving , also interviews 

--------------------------------------------------

# how to u improve 
1- devise  a plan for solving problems
2- master common problem  solving pattern

----------------------------------------

# problem sovling 
1- understand the problem 
2- explore concrete examples 
3- break it down 
4- slove / simplify 
5- look back and refactor


------------------------------
1- understand the problem 
- can u state the problem in my own words
- what is the input come into the problem 
- what is the output - how it look like
- u have enough info to get the output from the input
- how i label the impotance part of data
-

------------------------------
2- explore examples
- start with simple examples 
- progress to more complex examples 
- explore examples with empty inputs
- explore examples with invalid inputs



--------------------------------
3 - break it down 
- basic component of ur sotution

--------------------------------
4- solve it or simplify 
- skip the hard part to get it done 
- find the core difficulty in what u are trying to do 
- temporarily  ignore that difficulty 
- write simplify soln 
- then incorporate that difficulty back in 

----------------------------------
5- look back and refactor  
- can u check the result 
- can u derive the result differently 
- can u understand it in glance
- can u this solution in another prob 
- can u improve performance 
- can u refactor in antoher way 
- how have other people solved this prob
